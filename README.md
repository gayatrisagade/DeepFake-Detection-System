# DeepFake-Detection-System
 - Developed a Deepfake Detection System using Vision Transformers (ViTs) for image analysis and Recurrent Neural  Networks (RNNs) for audio classification to identify manipulated media.
 - Designed a user-friendly interface using Flask to enable easy interaction and live testing of the system.
